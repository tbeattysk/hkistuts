    <p>Entering grades and giving feedback in Schoology provides a lot of flexibility in how you can enter grades, how you can communicate with students and the ability to create a dialogue with students on their work. All of the versatility of this system means the variety of ways you can do things can be overwhelming. ***standards vs learning outcomes vs report cards***</p>
    <p>Note: This document will discuss "Learning Outcomes" ***add learning outcome image*** as they are called in Schoology, for our purposes these are the standards as they appear on the report card.</p>

        <h2>1. Setting up the gradebook</h2>
        Your will need to setup and familiarize yourself with the gardebook folder before starting your year.
        <img src="res/GradeBookSetup.jpg">
        <h4> Categories</h4>
        <p>This is where you can add, remove and rearrange different grading categories. Changes here will reflect how students and parents see their grades.</p>
        <aside class="hint blue">
            <div class="top"><span>Standard Expectation</span></div>
            <p>All courses need to have a "Summative" category listed first and a "Formative" category listed second. If your formative folder becomes very large, you may consider creating a category for each semester.</p>
        </aside>
        <h4>Grade Scales</h4>
        <p> There are three pre-made scales for middle school, you will use in the gradebook system.
        <ul>
            <li>MS Gradebook Scale (Percent)
                <div>This scale is used for gradebook items that don't use rubrics. Using this scale for assignments ***link to assignment tutorial*** will show students and parents the level (DE,AE,ME) instead of the number score.</div>
            </li>
            <li>MS Rubric Scale (Point)
                <div>This scale has 3 points for DE, AE and ME. It should be used within rubrics only.</div></li>
            <li>MS Approaches to Learning (Percent)
                <div>This scale </div></li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Other settings</h4>
        <p> The other options available are for grading periods (these are set for us) and final grades. Final grades should be set to hidden *** add phot ***

    	<h2>2. Setting up Assignments</h2>
    	<p> Continuing from the last tutorial on <a href="/collectingstudentwork.html">collecting student work</a> there are a couple important steps to creating an assignment in that will be graded. Of course, you should always follow the <a href="/collectingstudentwork.html#naming-convention">naming convention</a> and it is important for parents and students that all assignments have a <a href="/collectingstudentwork.html#due-date">due date</a>. </p>
    	
    	<h4>Choosing a category</h4>
		<p>Assignments of a category of "Ungraded" do not appear in student grades, it must be given a formative or summative category. <br />***add gif of setting category***</p>
    	
    	<h4>Setting the scale or rubric</h4>
		<p>All graded items in Schoology needs instructions on how to interpret the teachers input. You have two choices for communicating grades to students:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>MS Scale</strong> is used when the assignment only assesses one "learning outcome" ***add learning outcome image***</li>
			<li><strong>Custom Rubric</strong> is used when the assignment assesses more than one "learning outcome"</li>
    	</ul>
    	<p>The rest of this document will focus on using the MS Scale. Details on setting up rubrics is in the next tutorial.<p>
    	
    	<h4>Assigning the total points for a scale</h4>
		<p>The Schoology system doesn't care what the total points of an assignment is (it will always store it as a decimal number between 0 and 1). The MS Scale follows uses 3pts, and it is best practice to replace the 100 points with 3 points to reflect the scale.</p>
		
		<aside class="hint blue">
    		<div class="top"><span>Standard Expectation</span></div>
			<p>In Schoology we use a 3 pt scale:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Developing Towards Expectations (0-0.49)</li>
				<li>Approaching Expectations (0.50-0.75)</li>
				<li>Meets Expectations (0.75-1.00)</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The level of exceeds expectation needs to be written in the comment feedback. Check out <a href="...">this blog article</a> for an explanation of this choice.</p>

    	<h2>3. Gradebook Overview</h2>

    	<h2>4. Entering student grades and feedback</h2>
    	<p> You can input grades from three different places on Schoology. In each location there are multiple places to write feedback, but certain places won't show up in the student grades view.
    	<h4>Gradebook</h4>
    	<p>Each cell in the gradebook can be filled in two different ways, by typing in the desired value (1,2 or 3) or after you click on one of the cells, the options for ME, AE and DE are shown.</p> ***Image of input options***
    	<p> Every cell also has has a input bubble, to put in a comment that will appear to students in their grade view. Be sure to check the "show to student" box. There is also the options to mark the assessment as missing, exempt or incomplete for that student.</p>
    	
    	<h4>Assignment</h4>
    	<p> Within the assignment view, where you would look to see student submissions, there is grade editing button. This view provides a clear form for filling in both the grade and feedback for the assignment. There isn't an option to mark the assignment missing or exempt. </p>
    	***image of inputing grades
    	
    	<h4>Student Submission</h4>
    	<p>The last place to input student grades is in the student submission view. If the assignment can be graded, an input box at the top right of the screen fills in the overall grade. By clicking on the input box brings up a feeback box as well.</p>
    	***gif of inputing grades here
    	<aside class="hint red">
    		<div class="top"><span>Caution</span></div>
			<p>The comment box to the right of the submission area is meant to be a discussion with the student about the submission and not about the overall grade for the assignment. Comments here <strong>won't show up on the students grade views</strong>.</p>
			<p>Similarly the comments on each of a rubric's criteria won't appear in the student grades view.</p>
