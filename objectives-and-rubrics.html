    	<h2>1. Learning Objectives</h2>
		<p> <em>"An effective standards-based grading and reporting system should eliminate the overall or 'omnibus' grade. In its place, teachers should score specific measurement topics" </em><br />- Marano and Haflebower</p>
		<p>In Schoology, these "specific measurement topics" are called <em>Learning Objective</em>. Learning objectives are tagged to any resource in Schoology, items that are graded (assessments) are tracked in the <a href="#mastery">mastery</a> system.<p>
			
    	<h4>Importing and Creating Learning Objectives</h4>
		<p>Learning objectives are not stored inside a course. Instead, they are managed by either the school, a Schoology Group or in your personal resources.</p>
			
		<aside class="hint">
    		<div class="top"><span>Best Practice</span></div>
		<p>As you work with learning objectives and see how they work, you may need to make changes. The best place to do this would be in your learning team group. This way, you can quickly make changes to the objectives title or description and the changes only need to be made once instead of once per person on your team. Alternatively, you can follow these steps for your personal resources.
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Activate the Learning Objectives in you group by going to  <code>Options -> Enable Learning Resources</code> in your group resources.</li>
			<li>For each course your learning team teaches make a folder by going into the learning objectives folder, then to <code>Add -> Folder</code> and naming it appropriately</li>
			<li>***Current Schoology Bug Doesn't Allow This Step*** For each course, import your report card expectations by going to: <br/><code>Add -> "State Standard, Common Core ..." -> Custom Learning Objectives -> School -> (Your Standards)</code> </li>
		</ol>
		<p>Lastly, to help teachers give effective feedback we can add an abbreviation at the beginning of the learning objective title. The title will then look like this <br /><code> [NS] The Number System</code> <br /> It is important that the abbreviation is unique in your course and won't be confused with a grade scale (DE, AE, ME, EE).</p>
