    	<h2>1. Learning Objectives</h2>
		<p> <em>"An effective standards-based grading and reporting system should eliminate the overall or 'omnibus' grade. In its place, teachers should score specific measurement topics" </em><br />- Marano and Haflebower</p>
		<p>In Schoology, these "specific measurement topics" are called <em>Learning Objective</em>. Learning objectives are tagged to any resource in Schoology, items that are graded (assessments) are tracked in the <a href="#mastery">mastery</a> system.<p>
			
    	<h4>Importing and Creating Learning Objectives</h4>
		<p>Learning objectives are not stored inside a course. Instead, they are managed by either the school, a Schoology Group or in your personal resources.</p>
			
		<aside class="hint">
    		<div class="top"><span>Best Practice</span></div>
		<p>As you work with learning objectives and see how they work, you may need to make changes. The best place to do this would be in your learning team group. This way, you can quickly make changes to the objectives title or description and the changes only need to be made once instead of once per person on your team. Alternatively, you can follow these steps for your personal resources.
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Activate the Learning Objectives in you group by going to  <code>Options -> Enable Learning Resources</code> in your group resources.</li>
			<li>For each course your learning team teaches make a folder by going into the learning objectives folder, then to <code>Add -> Folder</code> and naming it appropriately</li>
			<li>***Current Schoology Bug Doesn't Allow This Step*** For each course, import your report card expectations by going to: <br/><code>Add -> "State Standard, Common Core ..." -> Custom Learning Objectives -> School -> (Your Standards)</code> </li>
		</ol>
		<p>Lastly, to help teachers give effective feedback we can add an abbreviation at the beginning of the learning objective title. The title will then look like this <br /><code> [NS] The Number System</code> <br /> It is important that the abbreviation is unique in your course and won't be confused with a grade scale (DE, AE, ME, EE).</p>

            <div class="top"><span>Caution</span></div>
        <p>
        Learning objectives in schoology are NOT linked to standards in Power School. If you make changes to learning objectives you will need to inform the office of changes that need to be made in Power School to reflect the final report card.

    	<h4>Aligning to Assessments</h4>
		<p>When creating an assessment, click the learning objectives icon to choose your alignments.</p> <br/>
        ***Add gif of choosing alignment
        <p>If you will be making more than one alignment, you can choose multiple learning objectives. However, all the aligned objectives will be given the same score. As this is likely not what you will want, use a rubric.</p>

    	<h2>2. Rubrics</h2>
		<p>If you have already chosen multiple learning objectives, making a new rubric is easy. Simply, click on <code>scale->create rubric</code> and a rubric will be created.</p>
		
    	<h4>Setting The Criteria Scale</h4>
		<p>We have pre-loaded the "MS Rubric Scale" that can be set in the top right of the rubric setup.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Putting Exeeding Expectations into your rubric</li> ***create blog post***
            <li>Do you assess the same outcome multiple times? There are two options: ...more...</li>
            <ol>
                <li>Make multiple schoology assignments for different parts of the assessment</li>
                <li>Use criteria to commnicate the level of achievement in each part of the assessment, provide an overall level of achievement for the Learning ojective</li>
            <p>Note: This may be an indication that your objectives are too general, and should be more specific</p>
            </ol>

        </ul>
		
    	<h4>Other Considerations</h4>
		<p>If there are criteria in your rubric that you don't want to be tracked</p>
