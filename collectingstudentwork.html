    	<p> Note: Below I use <em>assessment</em> to refer to either the Schoology assignments, online tests, or discussions, as these three are fully interchangeable. For more information on Schoology online tests and discussions, <a href="#disc-and-tests">see the final section</a> of this document. 

        <h2>1. Homework</h2>
    	<p>We use the Schoology materials to communicate to parents and students the work they are expected to have ready for the next class. By maintaining a common structure between all classes, teachers can communicate a lot through their folder structure and a common naming convention. </p>
        
        <h4>Location of homework in materials</h4>
    	<p>As mentioned in the <a href="/course-setup.html">Course Setup Tutorial</a>, the best practice for homework is to have a dedicated homework folder (alternatively a folder within each unit could be used). Homework assignments shouldn't be assessed unless they are given a <a href="#homeworktracking">specific grading category</a> with a completion grading scale. Anything that is assessed should be in the unit folders, which communicates to students and parents what is assessed and what the expectation is.</p>
	    
	    <h4>Naming convention</h4>
	    <p>The naming convention for all materials need to communicate the following:
		<ul>
			<li>What the item is; homework, test, project, etc.</li>
			<li>What class it is for (which is useful for when students view the item from their home screen or calendar)</li>
			<li>The title of the item</li>
			<li>When the item is due</li>
			<li>When the item was issued</li>
		</ul>
    	<aside class="hint blue">
    		<div class="top"><span>Standard Expectation</span></div>
			<p>All homework assignments will follow this format:<br/>
			<code>HW: Math: Fraction Practice: Issued Aug 10</code><br />
			This indicates that it is homework, that it informs what needs to be prepared for that day. Then, the class that it is assigned to along with a brief descriptive title for the assignment, and finally the date the work was assigned.
		</aside>
		</p>
	    
	    <h4>Due date expectation</h4>
	    <p>
	    The naming convention does not inform the date the homework is due, but this is built into all Schoology assignments, discussions and tests. 
    	<aside class="hint blue">
    		<div class="top"><span>Standard Expectation</span></div>
			<p>The due date for all items should be made for <strong>the day it is taken up</strong>. This keeps assignments consistent for students to consider "on Tuseday night I need to see what I have to finish for Wednesday and Thursday." They can see this by looking at their calendar like below.<br/>

		</aside>
		
		<h4>When to use a drop box</h4>
		<p>Although homework assignments aren't graded, the dropbox can be used for collecting student work such as drafts or reflections. </p><p><img src="res/dropboxicon.png"></p></br>

    	<aside class="hint red">
    		<div class="top"><span>Caution</span></div>
			<p>If students don't need to submit work into a drop box it is important to deactivate it. Otherwise the students home screen will have a persistent late assignment notification. It is always possible to go back and edit assignments that have a dropbox that needs to be de-activated. <br /> <img src="res/overdue.png"></p>
		</aside>

		<h4 id="homeworktracking">Tracking homework in the gradebook</h4>
		<p>Although not necessary, you can keep track of when students complete their homework and when they do not using the Schoology grade book. This will require three steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Creating a "Homework" category in the course <a href="/course-setup.html#gradebookSetup">gradebook setup</a>.</li>
				<li>Create a "Completion Percent Scale" <a onclick="toggle_visibility('completionScale')">show video</a>
					<p id="completionScale" style="display:none">Video not created yet, contact support.</p></li>
				<li>Use the "Homework" category and the "Completion" scale in all homework assignments that you want to be tracked.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>This method may not be as useful as a low-tech alternative. Because not all homework assignments will be checked for completion, it could be confusing for students on how the expectation differs for different homework assignments. A better alternative for communicating student preparedness for class would be by using regular approaches to learning rubrics or reflections.

    <section id="graded-assignments">

        <h2 id="naming-convention">2. Graded Student Work</h2>
        
        <p>To help students distinguish between homework requirements and graded assignments, there are two indicators. First, homework requirements should be inside of the homework folder whereas graded assignments and tests should appear somewhere inside the unit folder. Second and more importantly, homework assignments will always begin with "HW" in its title and graded assignments will have a more descriptive start to the title such as "Test", "Project", "Lab", "Essay", etc.

        <aside class="hint blue">
        	<div class="top"><span>Standard Expectation</span></div>
			<p>All graded assignments and tests will be labeled with the type of assessment followed by the course, a descriptive title and the issued date: <br/>
			<code>Test: LA: Fictional Writing: Issued Sept 6th</code><br/>
			Assessment types include but are not limited to: Test, Quiz, Project, Lab, Essay, Report, Writing, etc.
			</p>

		<h4>Summatives and Formatives</h4>
        <p> 
        <ul>
    		<li>HKIS Philosophy of Assessment <a onclick="toggle_visibility('assessmentpolicy')">show</a></li>
  			<div id="assessmentpolicy" style="display:none">
  				<p><strong>Formative assessment</strong> - Assessment tasks that are designed to give students feedback over time that will enable them to set goals and move forward with their learning as opposed to making a final judgment about a student’s ability.</p>
  				<p><strong>Summative assessment</strong> - Assessment tasks that are designed to capture a student’s performance at one point in time after instruction and to make a judgment about the student’s ability according to a grade-level benchmark. These assessments are used to inform report card grades.</p>
  				<p><a href="http://www.hkis.edu.hk/learning/curriculum-overview/teaching-for-understanding/index.aspx">Referenced Link</a></p>
  			</div>
    	</ul>
    	<p>
    	Indicating either formative or summative is best done in the <strong>descriptive title</strong>, so the above example could be written as "Fictional Writing Formative" or "Fictional Writing Summative". When using Schoology for grading and feedback, this descriptor is slightly repetitive as the category of the assignment already indicates wether it is formative or summative.
    	</p>
    	<p> Summative assessments may also be indicated by a * at the very beginning of the assignment name, which is valuable when grading in Schoology because of the <a href="mastery-setup.html">mastery system</a>.

        <h4 id="due-date">Due dates are important</h4>

    	<aside class="hint red">
    		<div class="top"><span>Caution</span></div>
			<p>When using Schoology for grading and feedback it is important to <strong>assign a due date to all graded work</strong>. In the student view of their grades:</p>
				<ul>
					<li> items without a due date appear first in alphabetical order,</li>
					<li> followed by all items with a due date in chronological order.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Mixing the two can be a bit confusing. <br /> 
                <!-- add image of confusing gradebook -->
                </p>
		</aside>

        <h4>Using dropbox to track student completion</h4>
        <p>Providing students reminders for unfinished work is built into Schoology and will appear on the students homepage. However, the best way to do this is by using the assignment dropbox: this could be having students submit a digital copy of their work, a reflection of their work (written, video or audio), or a quick summary of what they submitted. Once students have submitted their work, you can track all the student progress in the assignment.
        </p>
        <p> Alternatively, you can tag graded assignments as "incomplete" or "excused" for students as needed.</p>

        <h2>3. Discussions and Tests</h2>
        <p>Often underutilized tools on Schoology, discussions and tests can be very useful for assessments, in-class activities, or even homework. Below are a few links to get you started:</p>
