    	<h2>1. Linking course sections</h2>
    	<p>Before we begin, you will want to link the concurrent sections of your courses together. This will save some headache when setting up your grade book, it will also allow for shortcuts when you are doing your grading.</p>

    	</ul>
    	<p> From the <code>Course</code> tab, go to <code>See All</code>. Click on the settings symbol (<img src="res/gear.png">) for the course section want to be linked. Then, choose the other sections to be linked.</p>

    	<aside class="hint red">
    		<div class="top"><span>Caution</span></div>
    		<p>Only link sections at the beginning of the year. When sections are linked, data from one of the sections will be lost. Never unlink sections mid-year, as gradebook data will be lost for the linked section.</p>
    	</aside>

    	<p> Once linked, materials added to the course will be added to all sections. There are options to make section specific material.</p>

    	<ul id="linkingFaq" style="display:none">
        	<li>Can I still hide materials for one section?
            <p> Yes, assignments, tests and discussions will initially be shared to all linked sections with the same due dates. You can specify the visibility for each section when you make it or anytime after.</p>
            </li>

        	<li>Can I assign different due dates for each section?</li>
            <p> Like the visibility of a resource, the due date is initially set for all section, but it is easy to differentiate between courses.</p>
        	<li>How do I access the gradebooks for each section?</li>
            <p> In the gradebook, there is a selector to switch between linked sections </p>

    	<h2>2. Building a folder structure</h2>
    	<p><strong>You may want to organize a previous years content, then move it to your new course </strong> A well organized materials section for your course will help students to navigate the course content. You may want to organize a past course material and then <a href="#courseContent">import it into your new course</a>.</p>

    	<aside class="hint blue">
    		<div class="top"><span>Standard Expectation</span></div>
    		<p>All courses must have a <strong>Course Syllabus</strong> at the top of its materials. The goal of this is to help orientate parents to your course.</p>

    		<div class="top"><span>Best Practice</span></div>

    	    <p id="homeworkLoc" style="display:none">Homework assignments help students track their daily work. These assignments clutter the class resources quickly and students usually access them from the calendar, not the resource. Any time something needs to be submitted, or referred to later, it is a better practice to make these resources within a different folder that would be easier to find.</p>

    	<h2>3. Importing course content</h2>
    	
    	<p>At the beginning of the year you may want to consolidate your teams resources in a group (or personal), which can be imported for all future year. Rather than import content throughout the year, you can import once, hide everything, then publish throughout the year.</p>

                    <p> Access your archived courses from <code>See All</code> under the <code>Course</code>. When you look under the archieved tab, you can access all the content from past courses.</p>
                    
                    <p>From within your archived course you can copy materials to your current courses.</p>

	    		<p>Using folders, you can quickly hide large amounts of material from student view. You can also make all the content in the folder hidden by:
                <ol>
                    <li>Set the folder availability to hidden and save changes</li>
                    <li>Set the folder availability back to visible but choose not to "Make folder contents visible"</li>
                    <li>The individual items can then be published as needed.</li>

    	<h2>4. Enabling alerts</h2>
    	<p>Email alerts can be very useful but also annoying, below are some suggestions when setting up alerts.</p>
    	<h4>Courses</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Alerts to activate:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Comments: These will inform you if students have made comments on content you have posted. For example if a student has a question about a homework assignment, they could comment directly in Schoology and you would be informed.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Alerts to disable:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Submissions: Unless you want to be emailed everytime a student submits their work, this should be disabled. A better summary of submissions are on your homepage under recent activity.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
    	<h4>Groups (curricular teams)</h4>
        <ul>
        <p>Most items can be activated depending on how your team uses it, some important ones are:</p>
            <li>Alerts to activate:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                When resources are added: You probably want to be informed when a peer adds a something like a quiz or an assignment. With this turned on there isn't any need for them to post an update or send an email.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <h4>Groups (school wide)</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Alerts to activate:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                For new updates: You will want to receive an email whenever administration posts an update.</li>
